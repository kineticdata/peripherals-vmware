=== Detailed Description
This handler is designed to check the status of a virtual machine task on a 
VMWare VSphere server that matches the given task id. It logs in to the VSphere 
server using the server's administrative URL, user ID and password that are set 
as info_value records for the task.  Once logged in, a Managed Reference Object
is created based on the task id so that the Task Object can be re-created. Once 
that is created, the Task object is traversed to retrieve and return the state
and message for the task.

This handler uses the VMWare VI (vSphere) Java API (see
http://vijava.sourceforge.net/ for more information).  The api is deployed as a
Java archive file (jar) and is stored in this handler's vendor directory.  If
the vijava jar file is stored somewhere else on the classpath, the jar file
stored in this handler's vendor directory is not used.  It is recommended that
there are no vijava jar files stored anywhere on the classpath, and that all
VMWare VSphere handlers contain the same vijava jar file in their vendor
directory.
