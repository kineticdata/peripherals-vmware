== VMWare_VSphere_VirtualMachine_Reboot_V1
Reboots the specified VMWare VSphere virtual machine.  This triggers a shutdown
of the guest operating system followed by an automatic power on.  This handler
requires the target virtual machine to have VMWare Tools installed.

For more information, see the Detailed Description section below.

=== Parameters
[VM Name]
  The name of the VM that you want to reboot.

==== Sample Configuration
VM Name::                 <%=@answers['VM Name']%>

=== Results
There are no results returned by this handler.

=== Detailed Description
This handler is designed to reboot a virtual machine on a VMWare VSphere
server that matches the name supplied to it.  It logs in to the VSphere server
using the server's administrative URL, user ID and password that are set as 
info_value records for the task.  Once logged in, the virtual machine name is
verified and then a signal is sent to it to reboot the VM.

This handler uses the VMWare VI (vSphere) Java API (see
http://vijava.sourceforge.net/ for more information).  The api is deployed as a
Java archive file (jar) and is stored in this handler's vendor directory.  If
the vijava jar file is stored somewhere else on the classpath, the jar file
stored in this handler's vendor directory is not used.  It is recommended that
there are no vijava jar files stored anywhere on the classpath, and that all
VMWare VSphere handlers contain the same vijava jar file in their vendor
directory.
