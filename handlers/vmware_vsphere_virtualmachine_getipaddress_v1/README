  The name of the Virtual Machine to get the ip address of.

=== Detailed Description
This handler is designed to get the ip address of a virtual machine on a VMWare 
VSphere server that matches the name supplied as a parameter. It logs in to the 
VSphere server using the server's administrative URL, user ID and password that 
are set as info_value records for the task.  Once logged in, the virtual machine 
name is verified and then the handler traverses the object to retrieve and 
return the virtual machines ip address.

This handler uses the VMWare VI (vSphere) Java API (see
http://vijava.sourceforge.net/ for more information).  The api is deployed as a
Java archive file (jar) and is stored in this handler's vendor directory.  If
the vijava jar file is stored somewhere else on the classpath, the jar file
stored in this handler's vendor directory is not used.  It is recommended that
there are no vijava jar files stored anywhere on the classpath, and that all
VMWare VSphere handlers contain the same vijava jar file in their vendor
directory.
