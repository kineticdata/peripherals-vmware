== VMWare_VSphere_VirtualMachine_Shutdown_V1
Shuts down the specified VMWare VSphere virtual machine matching.  This triggers
a shutdown of the guest operating system before powering the virtual machine 
off.  This handler requires the target virtual machine to have VMWare Tools
installed.

For more information, see the Detailed Description section below.

=== Parameters
[VM Name]
  The name of the VM that you want to shut down.

==== Sample Configuration
VM Name::                 <%=@answers['VM Name']%>

=== Results
There are no results returned by this handler.

=== Detailed Description
This handler is designed to shut down a virtual machine on a VMWare VSphere 
server that matches the name supplied to it.  It logs in to the VSphere server
using the server's administrative URL, user ID and password that are set as 
info_value records for the task.  Once logged in, the virtual machine name is
verified and then a signal is sent to it to go through the shut down process.  
The VM responds with a signal stating that the shutdown process has begun and 
the handler exits.

This handler uses the VMWare VI (vSphere) Java API (see
http://vijava.sourceforge.net/ for more information).  The api is deployed as a
Java archive file (jar) and is stored in this handler's vendor directory.  If
the vijava jar file is stored somewhere else on the classpath, the jar file
stored in this handler's vendor directory is not used.  It is recommended that
there are no vijava jar files stored anywhere on the classpath, and that all
VMWare VSphere handlers contain the same vijava jar file in their vendor
directory.
