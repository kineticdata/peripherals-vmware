== VMWare_VSphere_VirtualMachine_Clone_V1
Clones the given virtual machine.

=== Parameters
[VM Template Name]
  The name of the VM that you want to clone.
[VM Clone Name]
  The name of the new cloned machine.
[Mark as Template?]
  Specifies whether or not the new virtual machine should be marked as a template. 
  Value is either true or false.
[Datacenter Name]
  The name of the datacenter where you want the new Virtual Machine stored.
[Resource Pool]
  The name of the resource pool where you want the new Virtual Machine stored. 
  If left blank, the new Virtual Machine will be placed in the default Resource 
  Pool of the templates host.
[Power On?]
  Specifies whether or not the new virtual machine should be powered on after 
  the clone is complete. Value is either true or false.

==== Sample Configuration
VM Template Name:                      Test Task VM
VM Clone Name:                         Task Snapshot
Mark as Template?:                     false
Datacenter Name:                       Datacenter
Resource Pool:                         Resources
Power On?                              true

=== Results
[Task Id]
  Returns the task id of the clone so that the status can be easily checked 
  later on.

=== Detailed Description
This handler is designed to clone a virtual machine on a VMWare VSphere server 
that matches the name supplied as a parameter. It logs in to the VSphere server 
using the server's administrative URL, user ID and password that are set as 
info_value records for the task.  Once logged in, the virtual machine that the
clone will be based off of is verified to make sure that the machine exists. 
The handler then searches for and returns the datacenter and the resource pool 
if it was specified. If the resource pool was not specified, the main resource
pool of the host that that the template machine is stored on will be found and 
used. Once the signal is sent, the handler waits long enough to catch immediate 
errors, returns the task id and then exits.

This handler uses the VMWare VI (vSphere) Java API (see
http://vijava.sourceforge.net/ for more information).  The api is deployed as a
Java archive file (jar) and is stored in this handler's vendor directory.  If
the vijava jar file is stored somewhere else on the classpath, the jar file
stored in this handler's vendor directory is not used.  It is recommended that
there are no vijava jar files stored anywhere on the classpath, and that all
VMWare VSphere handlers contain the same vijava jar file in their vendor
directory.
