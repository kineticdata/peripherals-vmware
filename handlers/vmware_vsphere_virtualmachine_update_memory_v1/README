== VMWare_VSphere_VirtualMachine_Update_Memory_V1
Updates the amount of memory (in MB) for a Virtual Machine.

=== Parameters
[VM Name]
  The name of the VM that you want to update.
[Memory in MB]
  The amount of memory in mb to be allocated to the VM.

==== Sample Configuration
VM Name:                      Test Task VM
Memory in MB:                          200

=== Results
[Task Id]
  Returns the task id of the task so that the status can be easily checked 
  later on.

=== Detailed Description
This handler is designed to update a virtual machine on a VMWare VSphere server 
that matches the name supplied as a parameter. It logs in to the VSphere server 
using the server's administrative URL, user ID and password that are set as 
info_value records for the task.  Once logged in, the virtual machine that will
be updated is verified to make sure that the machine exists. Then a reconfigure
command will be sent to vSphere to update the amount of memory for the specified 
VM. Once the signal is sent, the handler waits long enough to catch immediate 
errors, returns the task id and then exits.

This handler uses the VMWare VI (vSphere) Java API (see
http://vijava.sourceforge.net/ for more information).  The api is deployed as a
Java archive file (jar) and is stored in this handler's vendor directory.  If
the vijava jar file is stored somewhere else on the classpath, the jar file
stored in this handler's vendor directory is not used.  It is recommended that
there are no vijava jar files stored anywhere on the classpath, and that all
VMWare VSphere handlers contain the same vijava jar file in their vendor
directory.
