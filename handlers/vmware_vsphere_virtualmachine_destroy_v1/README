== VMWare_VSphere_VirtualMachine_Destroy_V1
Destroys the given Virtual Machine.

=== Parameters
[VM Name]
  The name of the VM that you want to destroy.

==== Sample Configuration
VM Name:                      Test Task VM

=== Results
There are no results returned by this handler.

=== Detailed Description
This handler is designed to destroy a virtual machine on a VMWare VSphere server 
that matches the name supplied as a parameter. It logs in to the VSphere server 
using the server's administrative URL, user ID and password that are set as 
info_value records for the task.  Once logged in, the virtual machine name is 
verified and then a signal is sent for it to be deleted. Once the signal is 
sent, the handler does not wait for a response and immediately exits.

This handler uses the VMWare VI (vSphere) Java API (see
http://vijava.sourceforge.net/ for more information).  The api is deployed as a
Java archive file (jar) and is stored in this handler's vendor directory.  If
the vijava jar file is stored somewhere else on the classpath, the jar file
stored in this handler's vendor directory is not used.  It is recommended that
there are no vijava jar files stored anywhere on the classpath, and that all
VMWare VSphere handlers contain the same vijava jar file in their vendor
directory.
