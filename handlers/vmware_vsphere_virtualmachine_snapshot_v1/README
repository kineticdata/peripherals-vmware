== VMWare_VSphere_VirtualMachine_Snapshot_V1
Takes a snapshot of the target VMWare VSphere virtual machine matching.

=== Parameters
[VM Name]
  The name of the VM that you want to suspend.
[Name]
  The name of the snapshot.
[Description]
  The description of the snapshot.
[Include Memory Dump?]
  If true, a dump of the internal state of the VM is included in the snapshot.
[Quiesce the File System?]
  If true, the snapshot will quiesce the file system to assure that a disk
  snapshot represents a consistent state of the guest file systems.

==== Sample Configuration
VM Name:                      Test Task VM
Name:                         Task Snapshot

=== Detailed Description
This handler is designed to take a snapshot of the virtual machine on a VMWare 
VSphere server that matches the name supplied as a parameter. It logs in to the 
VSphere server using the server's administrative URL, user ID and password that 
are set as info_value records for the task.  Once logged in, the virtual machine 
name is verified and then a signal is sent to it to take a snapshot of the VM. 
Once the signal is sent, the handler does not wait for a response and 
immediately exits.

This handler uses the VMWare VI (vSphere) Java API (see
http://vijava.sourceforge.net/ for more information).  The api is deployed as a
Java archive file (jar) and is stored in this handler's vendor directory.  If
the vijava jar file is stored somewhere else on the classpath, the jar file
stored in this handler's vendor directory is not used.  It is recommended that
there are no vijava jar files stored anywhere on the classpath, and that all
VMWare VSphere handlers contain the same vijava jar file in their vendor
directory.
