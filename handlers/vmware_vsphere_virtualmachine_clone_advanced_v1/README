  Virtual Machine in.
[Folder]
  The name of the folder that you want to put the new Virtual Machine in.
[Resource Pool]
  The name of the resource pool where you want the new Virtual Machine stored. 
  If left blank, the new Virtual Machine will be placed in the default Resource 
  Pool of the templates host.
[Customization Spec]
  The name of the customization spec that you want to use to clone to the new 
  Virtual Machine.
[IP Address]
  The ip address that you want to give to the new Virtual Machine.
[Gateway]
  The gateway address that corresponds with the IP Address you are giving the 
  Virtual Machine.
[Subnet Mask]
  The subnet mask that corresponds with the IP Address you are giving the 
  Virtual Machine.
[Cluster]
  The cluster that you want to assign to the new Virtual Machine.
[Port Group]
  The name of the port group that you want to assign to the new Virtual Machine.
[Power On?]
  Specifies whether or not the new virtual machine should be powered on after 
  the clone is complete. Value is either true or false.

=== Results
[Task Id]
  Returns the task id of the clone so that the status can be easily checked 
  later on.

=== Detailed Description
This handler is designed to clone a virtual machine on a VMWare VSphere server 
that matches the name supplied as a parameter. This version of the handler
contains more options in the cloning process that the standard vmware clone
handler does. It logs in to the VSphere server using the server's administrative 
URL, user ID and password that are set as info_value records for the task.  Once 
logged in, the virtual machine that the clone will be based off of is verified 
to make sure that the machine exists. The handler then searches for and returns 
the datacenter and the resource pool if it was specified. If the resource pool 
was not specified, the main resource pool of the host that that the template 
machine is stored on will be found and used. Once the signal is sent, the 
handler waits long enough to catch immediate errors, returns the task id and 
then exits.

This handler uses the VMWare VI (vSphere) Java API (see
http://vijava.sourceforge.net/ for more information).  The api is deployed as a
Java archive file (jar) and is stored in this handler's vendor directory.  If
the vijava jar file is stored somewhere else on the classpath, the jar file
stored in this handler's vendor directory is not used.  It is recommended that
there are no vijava jar files stored anywhere on the classpath, and that all
VMWare VSphere handlers contain the same vijava jar file in their vendor
directory.
